    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:

## Use Cases

### 1. Caching Docker Images

Save built images to avoid rebuilding in subsequent workflow runs:

```yaml
- name: Save Docker image for caching
  uses: apicurio/apicurio-github-actions/save-docker-image@v2
  with:
    image-name: 'my-app'
    output-path: './cache/my-app.tar'

- name: Cache Docker image
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ./cache/my-app.tar
    key: docker-image-${{ hashFiles('Dockerfile') }}
```

### 2. Automatic Artifact Upload

The action automatically uploads the saved Docker image as an artifact (enabled by default):

```yaml
- name: Save and upload Docker image
  uses: apicurio/apicurio-github-actions/save-docker-image@v2
  with:
    image-name: 'my-app'
    artifact-name: 'my-app-image'
    artifact-retention-days: 7
```

To disable automatic artifact upload:

```yaml
- name: Save Docker image (no upload)
  uses: apicurio/apicurio-github-actions/save-docker-image@v2
  with:
    image-name: 'my-app'
    upload: 'false'
```

### 3. Multi-Job Workflows

Share Docker images between different jobs using automatic artifact upload:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Build and save image
      uses: apicurio/apicurio-github-actions/save-docker-image@v2
      with:
        image-name: 'my-app'
        artifact-name: 'my-app-docker-image'
        # Artifact is automatically uploaded

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Download image artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: 'my-app-docker-image'
    
    - name: Load Docker image
      run: docker load -i docker-image.tar
```

### 4. Release Artifacts

Include Docker images as release artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Save release image
  uses: apicurio/apicurio-github-actions/save-docker-image@v2
  with:
    image-name: 'my-app'
    tag: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    output-path: './release/my-app-${{ github.ref_name }}.tar'
    upload: 'false'  # Don't upload as artifact for releases

- name: Create Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    files: ./release/my-app-${{ github.ref_name }}.tar
```

## Requirements

- Docker must be available in the runner environment
- The specified Docker image must exist locally (built or pulled)

## Error Handling

The action will fail if:
- The specified Docker image doesn't exist
- Docker is not available
- There are insufficient permissions to write to the output path
- The disk space is insufficient
